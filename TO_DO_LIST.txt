TO DO LIST
==========

- Add security settings to avoid spamming:
    - a list of mail sender addresses allowed;
    - a list of mail sender IP allowed (with wildcards?);
    - a secret key in subject or as attached file (maybe as a faked GIF);
    - what to do with emails from invalid senders (delete, move, log);

- Simplify rules and rule manager

- Support to Contao Image Gallery content;
